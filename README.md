# Hand-Gesture-Robot
Hand gesture-controlled car using Arduino Uno, ADXL345 accelerometer, 433 MHz RF modules, and L293D motor driver. The transmitter reads hand gestures and sends commands wirelessly to the car, which responds with forward, backward, left, right, and stop movements.
This project is a wireless hand gesture-controlled car built using two Arduino Uno boards. The transmitter unit consists of an ADXL345 accelerometer that detects hand motion and sends directional commands (F, B, L, R, S) via a 433 MHz RF transmitter. The receiver unit, mounted on the car, includes an L293D motor driver and a 433 MHz RF receiver. It decodes the received signals and drives the motors accordingly to move the car forward, backward, left, right, or stop. This setup demonstrates basic wireless communication, sensor integration, and motor control using Arduino.
